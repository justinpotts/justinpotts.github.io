### The Short Version

My name's Justin. I'm a web developer and entrepreneur, passionate about changing
the world. I'm a Mozilla QA Intern, and am part of OU's Class of 2020, majoring
in Management Information Systems.

### The Long Version

I don't have a book written by me or about me yet, but if I did I'd list it here.
But in a more serious note... I love creating projects. I love creating businesses.
I love making a difference in people's lives and giving them something to talk
about. Some of my biggest influences are Steve Jobs, and Jack Dorsey. These
entrepreneurial figures have led me to become who I am today. These figures have
taught me to do things, whether it be making an app or starting a business, for
the love of the art, not the lust for the money.

You'll usually be able to find me on Mozilla's IRC network, lurking and helping
out community members. I have been a contributor, defending the open web for the
past three years, and am honored to have been selected as an intern for the summer
of 2016.

I've created various web apps as I explore different areas of programming and fields
of business, including [Terml.io](https://terml.io), and my most recent,
[Pattr.me](https://pattr.me). Both of these projects are open source, and you
can view their repos [here](https://github.com/justinpotts/terml.io) and
[here](https://github.com/justinpotts/pattr).

I will be attending the University of Oklahoma to pursue a degree in Management
Information Systems, a blend of computer science and business, hoping to minor
in Marketing. In 10 years, I see myself quickly progressing up the corporate ladder
on my way to leading a company to achieve something great, or building the
next great thing at a startup, working on an idea that today would be considered
impossible.
