Currently, I'm in the process of converting all of my posts and media from
Wordpress, over to this nifty little thing called Jekyll. Jekyll is essentially
a framework for setting up a blog, using markdown to write posts, and simple
HTML files to serve content. Even better, hosting is free (besides the custom
domain), if you use GitHub Pages.

For most people, having a Wordpress site is enough. Some may even use a
Wordpress.org site, which I have experimented with in the past. Garblemasher
ran off of Wordpress.com, and I was beginning to feel constricted in terms
of themes, customization, and of course, the ads. I didn't feel like upgrading
to Premium for all the extra features, and needed a change.

In order to showcase some of my programming abilities, mainly design, I decided
to transition to Jekyll to allow me more customization and opportunities to make
my site more open and lightweight.

I'm currently in the process of moving all of my posts, pictures, and other
stuff to my new site, so it may be lacking material for a little bit. Check
back soon for BIG updates to design, content, and some cool projects or demos
I may add.

Looking forward to seeing what will come of this new tool!
