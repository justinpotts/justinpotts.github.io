It is with much pleasure that I announce the release of Terml.io today as now an
open source tool that will help students not only study definitions, but now
expose them to real-life industry standard code.

Open sourcing Terml.io has always been something I wanted to do, however with
the payment system and premium feature integration, I opted to keep it closed
to encourage use of our own platform. From this point onward, I will be taking
mostly a hands-off approach. My colleague, Jeffrey Wang, will be in control of
all aspects from this point onward, and I will be a contributor should I decide
to make updates.

At this point in time, Terml.io is stable, with a clean design and good
functionality. There is no better circumstance to step back from this project,
although I hope it continues to grow from here. Thanks again, to all who
supported the product since its beginning. Keep rocking.
