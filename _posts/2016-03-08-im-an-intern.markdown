For the past three years, I’ve been a contributor at Mozilla, working on
everything from documentation, to quality assurance (QA), to development, on
projects like Mozillians and Firefox OS (now Connected Devices). I didn’t start
out with the goal of being an intern. In fact, when I started I had no intentions
other than wanting to do something cool for the web.

I started working with my mentor, Matt Brandt, on some cool projects with the
Web QA team. He showed me what it was like to be a part of an organization as
special as Mozilla, and how vital contributors were to the mission. I soon found
my own contributor to mentor, and was able to put myself in Matt’s shoes and see
the difference I could make as a mentor. The sense of community at Mozilla is
overwhelming, and you can truly feel the value they place on involvement.

At Mozilla, they like to use the word contributor, than volunteer. They want to
make people feel as if they’re contributing to something larger than themselves,
not just giving away free labor to a software corporation, and as a long-time
contributor, I feel like I’ve made a difference, and apparently, they did too.
I was invited to attend the first All-Hands Work Week in Portland — a week-long
work week to bring all teams and employees at Mozilla together, with a few core
contributors. I was honored to be selected as one of these core contributors to
attend the next two in Whistler, British Columbia, and Orlando, Florida. And now,
as an intern, I’ll be flying to London for this summer’s all-hands.

Throughout all of my blog posts, I’ve probably made it very clear, but I’ll say
it again — Never once in a million years would I have imagined myself being able
to be a part of something that values their contributors, enough to bring them
along and pay for them to come to a conference. Mozilla is truly a special
organization, and that’s why I feel so honored to be further integrated into the
mission and the organization as an intern.

This summer, I’ll have one free day of summer after my high school graduation
before I depart on a plane to Mountain View, California, the heart of Silicon
Valley where companies from Apple to Google to Mozilla call home.

I will be working as part of the Cloud Services Engineering and Operations Team
as a Quality and Automation Intern, working on ensuring Firefox’s Addons continue
to be the best marketplace compared to other browsers.

Though he’ll probably say something like “You did this yourself,” I want to give
a huge shoutout to Matt Brandt, my mentor for the past two years, for guiding me
along the way and teaching me everything he knows. I wouldn’t have made it this
far without him.

Also, Dave Hunt, my mentor last summer and official mentor for this summer for
helping expand my skill set and teaching me I can do more than I think I can.

Lastly, the Mozwebqa Team, Rebecca Billings, Krupa Raj, Bob Silverberg, Matt
Brandt, Dave Hunt, and Stephen Donner for putting up with my questions and always
being there.

Along the way, I’ll write more technical posts about what I’m working on, new
tools I’m working with, and my experience here.
