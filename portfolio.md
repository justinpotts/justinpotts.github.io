This is a page where I am showcasing all of my programming applications that I
have made over the years to allow myself and potential employers or mentors to
see how much I’ve grown as a coder and where I am today.

#### Pattr – Flask, Socket.io (November 2015 – Present)

Source code: [http://www.github.com/justinpotts/pattr/](http://www.github.com/justinpotts/pattr/)

Pattr is an online disposable chat room intent on providing users with privacy
and security online. Starting a chat is as simple as sharing a link, like
http://pattr.me/c/room-code and can have multiple people online at any time.

#### Terml.io – Flask, MySQL (May 2015 – November 2015)

Source code: [http://www.github.com/justinpotts/terml.io/](http://www.github.com/justinpotts/terml.io/)

I developed http://terml.io as a solution for students and teachers to make the
process of defining flashcards easier and more efficient. To read more about this
project and how it was started, view my blog post. You can read about the first
release of Terml.io here.

Relating this project to school, I would say this is like my “final project.” It
really sums up everything I know about best coding practices, web design, web
development, interaction with modules, creating saving, and modifying data, and
much more. If someone asked me “What do you know how to do?” right out of high
school, I would point them to this website. Not only has Terml.io given me a
stellar opportunity to learn about business, marketing, and research, but it has
allowed me to grow my portfolio ten-fold from where it was before. I’ve gotten a
lot of responses like “why did you choose to make this free,” and “you put so much
work into this, you should get some money out of it,” and even though I hope to
introduce premium accounts some day, I tell them that doing things like “This
isn’t work, it’s what I love to do,” and I think that Terml.io really exemplifies
my philosophy of that, not only of what I can do, in terms of high-quality coding,
but also what I love to do and why I do it.

#### Dr. Hodum Website Redesign – Twitter Bootstrap, HTML, CSS (April 2015)

#### Atmosity – Flask (January 2015)

Source code: [http://www.github.com/justinpotts/atmosity/](http://www.github.com/justinpotts/atmosity/)

This project was developed to view local weather statistics on a dashboard over
your home network. Designed to work in conjunction with a DIY Raspberry Pi weather
station. It also works with local weather data.

This project is built off of Flask, a Python web development framework similar to
Django. Without the Raspberry Pi integration, the app pulls local weather data
based on your given zip-code in the admin panel. You can then manually push for
an update that will be posted to your dashboard.

In the future, I hope to integrate this with an actual built DIY weather station.
This would push real time results automatically, based on a set period. The server
would be hosted by the Raspberry Pi and connect to your local network, allowing
anyone on your home network to view the statistics. Included in the reports would
be barometric pressure, humidity, and temperature.

Over time as the statistics and reports gather up, there would be enough data to
create a graph of each measurement. Depending on certain circumstances, one of
the large features would be able to export you data to a weather service to help
crowd source a large weather report database and help predict future outcomes and
trends.

Depending on market attention, I think it would be an interesting idea to package
this idea as a whole and sell it as an open source weather kit. Software would
come pre-installed on a pre-built weather station (made from an Arduino or
something similar). Consumers would then connect the device to a network and turn
it on, then start streaming data.

Developing this project was the first time I had ever built an entire web app
solo. Not only did I learn how to navigate through Python-based web frameworks,
I also learned how to interact with different Python libraries and create clear
and efficient code.

#### What To Wear – Django (January 2014)

Source code unavailable.

A simple web application that provides clothing options based on current weather
conditions.

This was a simple idea that I came up with to help myself understand some more
of the basics surrounding Django, as well as the way web elements interact with
data. My dad helped build some of the backend source code.

The app is pretty simple. It takes your zip code, then pulls local weather data.
Based on a set of limitations, it provides certain clothing options. For example,
40 degrees Fahrenheit would return long pants and a heavy jacket. 90 degrees
Fahrenheit would return shorts and a short sleeve shirt with flip flops.

Through the development of this application, I learned how to interact with web
elements through the manipulation of data, as well as the supporting back-end
structure in Django applications.

#### AisleMonkey – Django (August 2013) (Incomplete)

Source code unavailable.

An application dedicated to helping you find and sort products in your grocery
list. Aimed at making grocery shopping more efficient and accessible.

This was an app that my dad and I came up with, using a database to organize
items in your shopping list to make the fastest possible route through the
grocery store. We first went to our local grocery stores and logged each common
item and its aisle number. After doing so, we implemented a search feature that
would return the aisle that product was most likely found in. In the future, we
had hoped to implement the main idea of our app which would allow you to type a
grocery list and have it be sorted using our aisle database.

The hardest part about releasing this app to the public would be the necessary
crowd sourcing needed to gain information for grocery store layouts across the
country. However, after compiling all of the information, people would finally
have somewhere to go to find where the product was located.

Through this project, I learned how to experiment with the Twitter Bootstrap UI
Framework. I was in charge of finding icons and creating the layout for each page.
This has helped me in future projects like the redesign of my Physic’s teacher’s
website (see above).

Note: This web app was also developed by another group of guys a few months after
we created ours (ours was still in development at the time of their release). Many
more grocery sorting apps were created later on down the road as well. Ours has
the coolest name though if we’re counting points.
